        "<i>What was often difficult for people to understand about the design was that there was nothing else beyond URIs (URLs), HTTP, and HTML. There was no central computer controlling the Web no single network on which these protocols worked, not even an organization anywhere that ran the Web. The Web was not a physical thing that existed in a certain place, it was a space in which information could exist.</i>" &mdash;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving_the_Web" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee (from Weaving the Web)</a>

      <p>The Web is an open and globally decentralized document and application distribution platform. Documents (ie. web pages) and software (ie. web apps), written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other languages, are stored on computers (connected to the Internet) all around the world running applications called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" target="_blank">servers</a>, which listen for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">HTTP</a> requests (small packets of data asking for specific files or resources) coming from other computers connected to the Internet running applications known as "clients" or "agents" (which are typically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target="_blank">web browsers</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler" target="_blank">web crawlers</a>).</p>

      <p>Anyone can create a website or web app and host their files on their own server running on their own computer connected to the Internet, and anyone else can use any number of web browsers to request (ie. access) that website or web app over the Internet. As a platform, the Web has no central server, it's a collection of servers running on computers all over the world, which is what we mean when we say that the web is a "decentralized" platform. You don't need to ask anyone for permission or approval to run a server on the Web, all you need is a computer with an Internet connection, this is why we say the Web is an "open" platform.</p>

      <p>While no one owns and operates the Web (the platform) itself, the protocols (like HTTP), core languages (HTML and CSS) and JavaScript APIs are designed and maintained by an international organization called the W3C, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium" target="_blanks">the World Wide Web Consortium</a> which consists of businesses, nonprofit organizations, universities, governmental entities, and individuals (<a href="https://www.w3.org/get-involved/" target="_blank">anyone can join!</a>). The W3C don't own or control the Web (again, it's an open and decentralized platform), instead they're in charge of <em>describing</em> how it should work. These descriptions take the form of documents known as "specifications" (or "specs" for short) which are used as blue-prints for anyone interested in writing their own web server or web browser, as well as anyone interested in creating their own websites or web apps. If you don't follow the spec, then your browser, server, site or app won't be compatible with others on the platform (ie. it won't work).</p>

        At the moment you're using [YOUR-BROWSER] on your computer [YOUR-LOCATION] to access netnet.studio over the World Wide Web from our server in New Jersey, USA. But don't forget you can use any browser you like (because the Web is an open platform you don't get locked in to one specific app). netnet.studio is an web app we created in Chicago (mostly) and published on the Web by uploading it to our server. You can use netnet.studio to create your own websites or web apps, but remember that you can download anything you make on netnet.studio (just press the <code>[YOUR-HOTKEY]+S</code> key) and use any other code editor you want (or even a text editor) to keep working your website or web app, we don't want to lock you in either! 
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>
        If you want to publish something you make with netnet onto the World Wide Web yourself so that anyone connected to the Internet can see it you just need to host your files on a server. You can pick any server you like (<a href="https://homebrewserver.club/" target="_blank">even run your own!</a>) but if you create a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account you can connect it to netnet and host your projects on their server for free. 
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>
        Simply open the "functions menu" (by clicking netnet's face), make sure you're logged into your GitHub (by clicking "login"), then click on "my project" and run the "<code>publishProject()</code>" function.
