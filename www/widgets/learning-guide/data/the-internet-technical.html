      We're currently working on an interactive lesson which illustrates the journey a web-packet takes as it traverses the physical Internet around the world. Along the way we'll learn about various pieces of Internet infrastructure as well as explore how artists and activists have produced all sorts of creative works and interventions stemming from this fundamental understanding of what the Internet actually <i>is</i>.

      "<i>On a sunny morning at 7:45:03, one Internet packet is born. 60 bytes weight, with just one simple mission in life â€“ to get to the place called 173.252.120.6. Even though this does not sound like an exciting mission in life, things that happen in the next 1 second are pretty exciting. His journey starts with a fast 7ms jump, 5 meters away to the box called home router. Over the attic, where he passes through the switch where all the cables from the building meet, he jumps down to the street and into the underground cable that brings him to the main city router in Novi Sad. With a speed of 30.600.000 km/h he runs for 10 ms to Belgrade, to the SBB TelePark building.</i>" &mdash;<a href="https://labs.rs/en/packets/" target="_blank">SHARE LAB</a>
