      The Internet is actually a very real, very physical thing. You can touch it, you can smell it, it has a "delicious old odor" as Leonard Kleinrock put it. The Internet exists in time and space, and came into existence at specific time[s] and place[s]. Maybe it started in "deep military secrecy" within a "Cold War think-tank" as science fiction writer Bruce Sterling writes in his "Short History of the Internet". Or maybe "ground zero" for the "birth place of the Internet" was actually a dingy university classroom in California, as filmmaker Werner Herzog narrates in his existential documentary "Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World." Or maybe it didn't happen in the United States at all? Maybe it started in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davies" target="_blank">British Laboratory</a>? Or maybe it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYCLADES" target="_blank" style="">French Laboratory</a>?

      <b>Where did the Internet come from? When was it created? Who created it? And, perhaps most importantly, Why? To answer these questions...</b>
