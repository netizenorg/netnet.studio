  <h1>Our Code Reflects Our Values</h1>
  <p style="font-style: italic; text-align:center;">(but don't take our word for it, <a href="https://github.com/netizenorg/netnet.studio" target="_blank">audit it</a> yourself)</p>
  <br>

	<p>
		Don't get me started on "privacy policies", these days online platforms extract as much data as algorithmically possible—almost entirely unregulated—while they keep <i>their</i> code entirely private, protected by "intellectual property" laws (code which would otherwise reveal the egregious extent of their exploitation)
	</p>

	<p>
		Here's our policy: my creators at <a href="http://netizen.org" target="_blank">netizen.org</a> are strong advocates of privacy and transparency, which is why they give you complete control of Your Session Data via <b class="inline-link" onclick="WIDGETS.open('student-session')">this widget</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
    Any data about you that I save, whether it's personal data like your name or behavioral data like which widgets you've got opened and where you've placed them, is stored entirely locally in your browser on your computer and made accessible via the <b class="inline-link" onclick="WIDGETS.open('student-session')">Session Data</b> widget. NOTE: this means that if you visit netnet.studio on another browser I won't know who you are. This also means that if you are using a public computer you might want to delete this data before you leave.
	</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bolder; padding: 20px 0;">
    <b style="text-decoration:underline">None of your data leaves your browser</b>,<br>
      with a couple of deeply considered exceptions...
	</p>

  <h3>URL Shortener (short sharable sketches)</h3>
  <p>
    When you save a sketch you're given the option to either download it to your computer, upload it to GitHub (if you've connected to your account, more on that below) or generate a sharable URL. This sharable link encodes all the code in your sketch directly into the URL, meaning it's not stored or saved anywhere in the conventional sense, it exists intentionally and exclusively as a URL. Because they contain the compressed code of your sketch, those links can get pretty long. For your convenience you can opt-in to our URL shortener for shorter links to shareable sketches. If you choose to shorten a URL I'll send your code to my server to store in a data base of shortened URLs. There's no other way to shorten a URL (But feel free to disagree and update my code on <a href="https://github.com/netizenorg/netnet.studio" target="_blank">GitHub</a>), that said we don't sell or monetize these sketches in any way.
  </p>

  <h3>GitHub (data in transit)</h3>
	<p>
    The second exception happens if and when you connect me to your GitHub account to allow me to save any projects you make here as repositories (or "repos" for short) on your GitHub. In order to communicate with GitHub's servers I'll act as an intermediary, passing data along between your computer and GitHub when you decide to "push" updates to your account. Otherwise, while working on a project, all the code and assets never leave your browser. It took some clever engineering to pull that off, it would have been technically easier to store your code on our servers like most online code editors do, but that would compromise our values (again, you can refer to my open source code on <a href="https://github.com/netizenorg/netnet.studio" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for proof of this)
	</p>

  <h3>netnet stats (web analytics)</h3>
	<p>
    Lastly, we do store some server analytics, in order to make sure things run smoothly and to gain some high level insight on our traffic. This includes how many requests we're getting, when we're getting them, what sort of devices their coming from (operating system and browser) and where in the world they're coming from. My creators wrote their own custom <a href="https://github.com/nbriz/StatsNotTracks" target="_blank">analytics code</a> from scratch to avoid using third party analytics tools like Google analytics. This took a lot of effort, but we wanted to be 100% sure we were not unintentionally sharing any data with third parties (which has happened even to the <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/blacklight-tracking-advertisers-digital-privacy-sensitive-websites" target="_blank">best intentioned</a> web developers)
