<div class="privacy-policy">
	<p>
		Don't get me started on "privacy policies", these days online platforms extract as much data as algorithmically possible—almost entirely unregulated—while they keep <i>their</i> code entirely private, protected by "intellectual property" laws (code which would otherwise reveal the egregious extent of their exploitation)
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Here's our policy: my creators at <a href="http://netizen.org" target="_blank">netizen.org</a> are strong advocates of privacy and transparency, which is why they give you complete control of Your Session Data via <b class="inline-link" onclick="WIDGETS.open('student-session')">this widget</b>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Any data about you that I save, whether it's personal data like your name or behavioral data like which widgets you've got opened and where you've placed them, is stored entirely locally in your browser on your computer and made accessible via <b class="inline-link" onclick="WIDGETS.open('student-session')">this widget</b>. NOTE: this means that if you visit netnet.studio on another browser I won't know who you are. This also means that if you are using a public computer you might want to delete this data before you leave.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Nothing you do in the studio gets sent back to the server, with a couple of exceptions: if you opt-in to our URL shortener for shareable sketches, I'll send your code to the server to store in a data base of shortened URLs. There's no other way to shorten a URL (But feel free to disagree and update my code on <a href="https://github.com/netizenorg/netnet.studio" target="_blank">GitHub</a>), that said we don't sell or monetize these sketches in any way.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The second exception happens if and when you connect your GitHub to allow me to save any work you make here in the studio as repositories in your GitHub account. In order to communicate with GitHub's servers I'll act as an intermediary, passing data along, but I don't store any of it on my server (again, refer to my open source code on <a href="https://github.com/netizenorg/netnet.studio" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for proof) long term, only temporarily while sending data back/fourth to your GitHub account.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Lastly, we do store some server analytics, in order to make sure things run smoothly and to gain some high level insight on our traffic. This includes how many requests we're getting, when we're getting them, what sort of devices their coming from (operating system and browser) and where in the world they're coming from. In order to be 100% sure we're not unintentionally sharing any data with third parties (which has happened to even the <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/blacklight-tracking-advertisers-digital-privacy-sensitive-websites" target="_blank">best intentioned</a> web developers) my creators wrote their own custom <a href="https://github.com/nbriz/StatsNotTracks" target="_blank">analytics code</a> from scratch (to avoid using third party analytics tools like Google analytics).
