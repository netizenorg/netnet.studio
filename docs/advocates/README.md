netnet.studio is still in *beta* but it's already being used by students at various universities. Here's what some of the Media Art and Design students at the University of Chicago have (anonymously) said about their experience using it in the classroom:

> "[netnet] was one of the coolest parts of the class. I really appreciated the interactivity of the software, as it allowed me to learn by doing as well as listening."

> "The interactive tutorials were fun and more engaging! Even though I have experience with HTML and CSS from other classes, I still felt that it was a good foundation for rally understanding how HTML works and found the tutorials valuable."

> "Coding on netnet really highlights the creative aspect of coding and obscures the more boring technical parts like git and version control etc. I think it's great for beginners and super user-friendly."

> "netnet was great because I could see all of my changes take place immediately [this] allowed me to experiment more."
