We're so glad you want to help improve netnet.studio! If you're a seasoned open source contributor, skIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project you'll need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup), if you've already got one make sure you're [logged in](https://github.com/login).

Getting started contributing to an open source project can be tricky and intimidating even for experienced coders. The netnet.sudio project is all about teaching creative coders about the craft and open source development is definitely a part of that! For that reason our docs are also meant to serve as a gradual introduction to open source contribution for those new to GitHub. It starts with easier contributions (like editing mistakes you found in netnet's dialogue) and eventually gets into to more complex contributions (like editing netnet's core functionality). Each step not only slowly introduces you to our code base, but also to the process of open source contribution more generally, staring with how to...

1. ### [edit some of netnet's dialogue](editing-dialogue)
2. ### [edit/create a code example/demo](code-examples)
3. ### edit/create a netnet widget
4. ### create a new interactive tutorial
5. ### working on core functionality
<br><br>
**contributing to netnet dependencies/submodules**
1. ### create a new netitor color scheme
2. ### working on the netitor's friendly errors
3. ### working on the netitor's edu info
4. ### working on the netitor's hinter (auto-complete snippets)
5. ### working on the netnet-standard-library (nn.min.js)
