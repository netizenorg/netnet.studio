Then we need to use the <code>src</code> property to point to the cyberdyne.ttf font file stored in the css/fonts directory of our website. \n<br><br>\nYou can find a ton of free to use fonts from sites like <a href=\"https://www.dafont.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dafont</a> or <a href=\"https://www.fontsquirrel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Font Squirrel</a> and ttf or woff font file types will both work.\n<br><br>\nIf you copy and paste the Google Font url from the previous step in a new browser window, you'll see that it will import similar <code>@font-face</code> rules into our CSS.\n"
